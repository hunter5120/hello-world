# hello-world
My first repository.
I'm going to try my hand at coding for the second time in life. My first attempt wasnt a complete disaster but i always felt that I wasnt understanding important concepts about programming. I could build small projects with a help of a guide but quickly became overwhelmed when it came time to solve problems. I would end up giving up in frustration. Im planning on following the odin project this time around. I know it will be hard but I dont plan on giving up this time.
